Multi-frames:
	- RNN (LSTM/GRU): How can we combine convolutional layers in it? Maybe before we put every sample x_i to the RNN we'll pass it through convolutional layer? https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.03867.pdf
	- ResNet (Can it be used on multiple input?)
	- Transformers (?) https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14503.pdf
Single-frame:
	- 2 sub-CNNs like OpenPose
	- Many sub-CNNs like the paper Ron sent
	- ResNet
